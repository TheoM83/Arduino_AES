## Introduction
This code example permits to encrypt and decrypt strings of any length using aes-128. If the string's length is not a multiple of 16, it will pad the message with the desired character.

## Setup
In order to run this exemple, you will need the Crypto library mad by Brandon Wiley installed.
It can be found in the library manager on the Arduino IDE or on this website : https://rweather.github.io/arduinolibs/crypto.html
